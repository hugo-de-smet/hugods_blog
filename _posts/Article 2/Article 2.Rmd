| **General topic**               | Using a part of cone snail venom as a better version of insulin used in modern medicine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Procedure/what was examined** | Researchers aimed to create a new type of insulin that would combine the fast acting potential of  venom insulin produced by the cone snail and thye potency of human insulin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Conclusions/discovery**       | Researchers discovered that the venom insulin was way faster than human one but less potent. To solve the problem, they used structural biology and medicinal chemistry techniques to isolate the four amino acids they were interested in and truncated a version of human insulin molecule without the region  responsible for clumping^. They made a combined version of insulin presenting the potency of human insulin and the fast acting properties of the cone snail one, they called this new insulin : "Mini insulin"  |
